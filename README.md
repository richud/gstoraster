gstoraster was removed from ghostscript after 9.07 and put into cups-filters.

cups-filters as a ton of dependencies and all I needed was gstoraster in order to print with cups.

This is simply the removed files that can be compiled and used with cups and ghostscript (gstoraster is esentially a wrapper for ghostscript)
